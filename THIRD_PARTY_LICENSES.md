# Third-Party Licenses

This document lists licenses of third-party JavaScript dependencies installed via npm.
It is generated for convenience and may not be exhaustive of optional external tools
(PlantUML, Graphviz, Inframap, Mermaid CLI), which are distributed by their own projects.

## Generate / Update

```bash
npm run licenses:report
