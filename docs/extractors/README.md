# Extractors

**Extractors are the eyes of Archlette.** They analyze source code, configuration files, and infrastructure definitions to extract architectural information.

Each extractor understands a specific language or framework. Pick the ones that match your stack.

## Available Extractors

### Basic Node

**Path:** `extractors/builtin/basic-node`

Analyzes TypeScript and JavaScript codebases using JSDoc annotations.

**Extracts:**

- Components (modules, namespaces)
- Actors (users, external systems)
- Relationships (dependencies between components)
- Code elements (classes, functions)

**Best for:** Application code, services, APIs, libraries

### Basic Wrangler

**Path:** `extractors/builtin/basic-wrangler`

Analyzes Cloudflare Wrangler configuration files to extract deployment topology.

**Extracts:**

- Containers (Cloudflare Workers)
- Deployments (production, staging, preview environments)
- Service bindings (worker-to-worker dependencies)
- Infrastructure bindings (KV, R2, D1, Durable Objects, Queues)

**Best for:** Cloudflare Workers microservices architecture

## Configuration Pattern

**Typical setup:**

```yaml
extractors:
  - use: extractors/builtin/basic-node
    inputs:
      include: ['src/**/*.ts']
      exclude: ['**/*.test.ts']
```

**All extractors support:**

- `use` ‚Äî Path to extractor module
- `name` ‚Äî Optional friendly name
- `inputs` ‚Äî File patterns (include/exclude)
- `props` ‚Äî Extractor-specific configuration

---

## Multiple Extractors

**Extractors run in sequence.** Outputs merge into a single Intermediate Representation (IR).

**Example: Full-stack application**

```yaml
extractors:
  # Application code
  - use: extractors/builtin/basic-node
    name: app-code
    inputs:
      include: ['src/**/*.ts']

  # Deployment topology
  - use: extractors/builtin/basic-wrangler
    name: worker-deployment
    inputs:
      include: ['iac/workers/**/*.toml']
```

**Result:** One architecture with both logical components (from code) and physical deployments (from config).

---

## Coming Soon

**Planned extractors:**

- üî∏ **basic-python** ‚Äî Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
- üî∏ **basic-terraform** ‚Äî Infrastructure as Code (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- üî∏ **basic-docker** ‚Äî Docker Compose
- üî∏ **basic-openapi** ‚Äî REST API specifications
- üî∏ **basic-graphql** ‚Äî GraphQL schemas

## Build Your Own

**Creating custom extractors is straightforward:**

1. Implement the `ArchletteExtractor` interface
2. Return `ArchletteIR` conforming to the schema
3. Register in your `.aac.yaml`
