# Choosing Extractors

**Extractors analyze source code and configuration to understand your architecture.**

Each extractor speaks a different language. Pick the ones that match your stack.

## By Language & Framework

| Extractor                                         | Analyzes               | Best For                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| [basic-node](../extractors/basic-node.md)         | TypeScript, JavaScript | Application code, services, APIs, libraries |
| [basic-wrangler](../extractors/basic-wrangler.md) | Wrangler TOML          | Cloudflare Workers deployment topology      |

## By Architecture Pattern

### Monolithic Application

**Single codebase, one repository:**

```yaml
project:
  name: MyMonolith

extractors:
  - use: extractors/builtin/basic-node
    inputs:
      include: ['src/**/*.ts']
      exclude: ['**/*.test.ts']
```

**Extracts:** Components, actors, relationships from JSDoc annotations.

---

### Microservices on Cloudflare

**Multiple Workers, deployed independently:**

```yaml
project:
  name: WorkerMicroservices

extractors:
  - use: extractors/builtin/basic-wrangler
    inputs:
      include: ['workers/**/*.toml']
```

**Extracts:** Workers as containers, service bindings, infrastructure dependencies (KV, R2, D1, Queues).

---

### Full-Stack Application

**Code + deployment topology:**

```yaml
project:
  name: FullStackApp

extractors:
  # Application logic
  - use: extractors/builtin/basic-node
    inputs:
      include: ['src/**/*.ts']
      exclude: ['**/*.test.ts']

  # Infrastructure
  - use: extractors/builtin/basic-wrangler
    inputs:
      include: ['iac/workers/**/*.toml']
```

**Extracts:** Both logical architecture (from code) and physical deployment (from Wrangler config).

---

### Monorepo

**Multiple packages, shared repository:**

```yaml
project:
  name: MyMonorepo

extractors:
  # API service
  - use: extractors/builtin/basic-node
    name: api-service
    inputs:
      include: ['packages/api/src/**/*.ts']
      exclude: ['**/*.test.ts']

  # Web application
  - use: extractors/builtin/basic-node
    name: web-app
    inputs:
      include: ['packages/web/src/**/*.tsx']
      exclude: ['**/*.test.ts', '**/*.stories.tsx']

  # Shared library
  - use: extractors/builtin/basic-node
    name: shared-lib
    inputs:
      include: ['packages/shared/**/*.ts']
      exclude: ['**/*.test.ts']
```

**Tip:** Name each extractor to distinguish containers in diagrams.

## What Extractors Don't Do

**Extractors analyze structure, not behavior:**

- ‚ùå Don't trace runtime execution
- ‚ùå Don't measure performance
- ‚ùå Don't detect security vulnerabilities
- ‚ùå Don't analyze database schemas (yet)

**They extract static architecture:**

- ‚úÖ Components and their boundaries
- ‚úÖ Dependencies and relationships
- ‚úÖ Deployment topology
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure bindings

## Coming Soon

**Planned extractors:**

- üî∏ **basic-python** ‚Äî Python packages (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
- üî∏ **basic-terraform** ‚Äî AWS, Azure, GCP infrastructure
- üî∏ **basic-docker** ‚Äî Docker Compose orchestration
- üî∏ **basic-openapi** ‚Äî REST API contracts
