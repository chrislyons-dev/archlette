# Getting Started

Architecture from code. Automatically.

Three paths. Choose your journey.

---

## 🚀 Quick Path

**Want to see it work?** → [Quick Start](quick-start.md)

Generate your first architecture diagram in 3 minutes. Install, annotate, generate.

**Best for:** Evaluating Archlette, proof of concept, demos

---

## 📚 Learning Path

**First time with Architecture-as-Code?** → Start here

1. [Installation](installation.md) — Set up Node and Java
2. [Quick Start](quick-start.md) — Generate first diagram
3. [Choosing Extractors](choosing-extractors.md) — Match your tech stack
4. [Annotations Reference](../guide/annotations.md) — Learn the markup
5. [Configuration](../guide/configuration.md) — Customize behavior

**Best for:** New users, learning the concepts, building understanding

## 🎯 Goal-Oriented Path

**Know what you need?** → Jump to your goal

### I want to document my architecture

1. [Installation](installation.md)
2. [Choosing Extractors](choosing-extractors.md) — TypeScript? Python? Cloudflare?
3. [Annotations Reference](../guide/annotations.md) — Mark your components
4. [Quick Start](quick-start.md) — Generate diagrams

### I want to integrate with CI/CD

1. [Installation](installation.md) — Ensure you meet requirements
2. [CI/CD Integration](../guide/ci-cd.md) — GitHub Actions, GitLab CI examples
3. [Configuration](../guide/configuration.md) — Set paths for automation

### I want to customize the output

1. [Configuration](../guide/configuration.md) — Control paths and behavior
2. [Themes](../themes.md) — Visual customization
3. [CLI Reference](../reference/cli.md) — Stage control and options

### I want to build a custom extractor

1. [Plugin Development](../plugins/extractors.md) — Extractor interface
2. [Configuration](../guide/configuration.md) — Reference custom plugins

**Best for:** Experienced developers, specific use cases, integration projects

## 💡 Common Scenarios

### Monolithic Application

**Stack:** Single TypeScript/JavaScript codebase

**Path:** [Quick Start](quick-start.md) → [Basic Node Extractor](../extractors/basic-node.md)

---

### Microservices on Cloudflare

**Stack:** Multiple Cloudflare Workers

**Path:** [Quick Start](quick-start.md) → [Basic Wrangler Extractor](../extractors/basic-wrangler.md)

---

### Monorepo with Multiple Services

**Stack:** Multiple packages, shared repository

**Path:** [Choosing Extractors](choosing-extractors.md) → See "Monorepo" example

---

### Python Services

**Stack:** Python applications (Django, Flask, FastAPI)

**Path:** Coming soon — basic-python extractor in development
